# CIS-5-Assignment_1

I started by opeing a new project and creating a new item in the source files tab
Then I imported a library that gives me access to input and output tools
I made it so that I did not need to type std:: every time I called cout and endl
I printed the text for each of the items being name, goals in life, current interests, dreams, and where I will be in 1,3,5, and 7 years
I formated it to print more readble by skipping likes and numbering each item
Then I ended the program with return 0;
